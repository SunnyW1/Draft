With lower temperatures, Pasco et al.(2019) observes a transition from high to low magnetic susceptibility and structural rearrangement from a two-layer unit cell to a six-layer unit cell. However, the role of stacking faults, or the misalignment of atomic layers, in the magnetic transition remains unknown.</description></item><item><title>Digital Signals and Image Processing Image Registration Project</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/imagereg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/imagereg/</guid><description>Introduction Within medical image processing, the process of image registration remains essential for the automated analysis of medical images. By comparing a set of experimental medical images to an established set of templates, the experimental images can undergo semantic segmentation- or the process of dividing the image into a set of various regions with established labels. In this project, I explore the application of image registration and segmentation on the coronal sections of the brain- indexed from a larger set of test fMRI images.</description></item></channel></rss>
