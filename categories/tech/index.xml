Understanding the photoelectric effect is essential as it serves as evidence for the quantum nature of light, or the description of light as discrete particles known as photons. To study the photoelectric effect, I obtain multiple IV curves for various frequencies of light by varying the applied voltage across the a photomultiplier tube.</description></item><item><title>Project 2 Understanding Room Temperature MoTe2</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/mote2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/mote2/</guid><description>Introduction To better understand the room temperature phase of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe2, we take cross sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images of the bulk material at both the many-layer and few-nanometer limit. With these STEM images, we can map the interlayer displacements using image processing techniques in python. Overall, the project is divided into several steps: 1. identify any common stacking displacements across the cross-sectional images, 2. simulate a robust library of plan-view STEM images using this data, and 3.</description></item></channel></rss>
