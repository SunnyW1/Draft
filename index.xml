Automatic self-regulating systems play a vital role in both the real world and in laboratory settings. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is a widely used method of self-regulation as it is a robust method for calculating error and, subsequently, determining an appropriate response. To explore the PID controller capabilities of the Arduino Uno, I implement a magnetic levitation device where the distance of the suspended magnet is maintained using a PID algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Physics Lab 2 The Photoelectric Effect</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/work/photoelectric/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/work/photoelectric/</guid><description>Understanding the Photoelectric Effect The photoelectric effect refers to the process where solids emit electrons upon being illuminated by light with a frequency beyond a certain threshold. Understanding the photoelectric effect is essential as it serves as evidence for the quantum nature of light, or the description of light as discrete particles known as photons. To study the photoelectric effect, I obtain multiple IV curves for various frequencies of light by varying the applied voltage across the a photomultiplier tube.</description></item><item><title>Project 2 Understanding Room Temperature MoTe2</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/mote2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/mote2/</guid><description>Understanding the Room Temperature Phase and Phase Transitions of MoTe2 To better understand the room temperature phase of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe2, we take cross sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images of the bulk material at both the many-layer and few-nanometer limit. With these STEM images, we can map the interlayer displacements using image processing techniques in python. Overall, the project is divided into several steps: 1. identify any common stacking displacements across the cross-sectional images, 2.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Physics Lab 1 Learning the Arduino Uno</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/work/arduino/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/work/arduino/</guid><description>Learning the Arduino Uno With a Temperature Control System Data acquisition, or the collection of real-world measurements and conversion into digital data, has many applications within daily life and research. When performing an experiment, it is essential to regulate laboratory conditions and helpful to automate the data collection process to reduce sources of error. To explore data acquisition, this project focuses on using the Arduino Uno to monitor temperature, manage an external fan and heating pad based on the temperature readings, and display data on to an LCD display.</description></item><item><title>Project 1 Stacking Faults in Nb3Br8</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/nb3br8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/nb3br8/</guid><description>Identifying Stacking Faults within Cross-Sectional Nb3Br8 STEM Images Going from high to low temperatures, Nb​3Br8​ crystals undergo a transition from a paramagnetic material to a nonmagnetic material and experience a shift within its stack of 2-D atomic layers (Pasco et al., 2019). With lower temperatures, Pasco et al.(2019) observes a transition from high to low magnetic susceptibility and structural rearrangement from a two-layer unit cell to a six-layer unit cell. However, the role of stacking faults, or the misalignment of atomic layers, in the magnetic transition remains unknown.</description></item><item><title>Digital Signals and Image Processing Image Registration Project</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/work/imagereg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/work/imagereg/</guid><description>Medical Image Processing and Image Registration Within medical image processing, the process of image registration remains essential for the automated analysis of medical images. By comparing a set of experimental medical images to an established set of templates, the experimental images can undergo semantic segmentation- or the process of dividing the image into a set of various regions with established labels. In this project, I explore the application of image registration and segmentation on the coronal sections of the brain- indexed from a larger set of test fMRI images.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Automating the Titanium Sapphire Laser System</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/lasers_lab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 02:46:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/research/lasers_lab/</guid><description>Summary of Research Experience For Undergraduates (REU) at Colorado State University During the summer of my sophomore year, I broadened my perspective by pursuing research beyond Cornell University. I participated in the NSF funded REU for Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology (EUV) at Colorado State University under Professor Jorge Rocca. Working at the Advanced Beam Laboratory, the goal of my project was to automate the 0.85-petawatt Titanium Sapphire Laser system by using LabVIEW code to digitally interface with the analog systems.</description></item><item><title>Resume</title><link>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sunnyw1.github.io/draft/about/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
