# Summary of Research Experience For Undergraduates (REU) at Colorado State University

During the summer of my sophomore year, I broadened my perspective by pursuing research beyond Cornell University. I participated in the NSF funded REU for Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology (EUV) at Colorado State University under Professor Jorge Rocca. Working at the Advanced Beam Laboratory, the goal of my project was to automate the 0.85-petawatt Titanium Sapphire Laser system by using LabVIEW code to digitally interface with the analog systems. I developed several programs: an acquisition loop with power meters to record and display power measurements in real time, digital controls to maneuver an internal camera and target mount, and an interface with the laser firing system. In this project, I helped to automate the data acquisition process, paving the way for a rapid collection of measurements in future experiments. Under the tutelage of Prof. Rocca, I learned how to apply my engineering skill set—coding and interfacing with electronic systems—in the context of experimental physics and designed my own data acquisition procedure. At the end of the program, I presented my project at a EUV virtual symposium amongst other REU students and mentors. Through this program, I learned how to effectively communicate information in a presentation and how to apply my engineering knowledge beyond the classroom setting while exploring the field of laser science.
