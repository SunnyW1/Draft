#Introduction

To better understand the room temperature phase of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe2, we take cross sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images of the bulk material at both the many-layer and few-nanometer limit. With these STEM images, we can map the interlayer displacements using image processing techniques in python. Overall, the project is divided into several steps; 1. identify any common stacking displacements across the cross-sectional images, 2. simulate a robust library of plan-view STEM images using this data, and 3. recreate the experimental plan-view STEM images of MoTe2 taken across variable temperatures using the simulated images. With a robust simulated library, we more accurately identify the phase of the material within the experimental plan-view images, taken along its temperature transition from the 1T’ to the Td phase. Doing so will map the path of transition within the material which can then be repeated for samples with varying thicknesses. Although understanding the 1T’ to Td phase transition of the material with varying thicknesses is the overarching goal of this project, the current focus is to identify the common structures of both bulk and few-layer MoTe2 at room temperature.

##Note
I am currently having difficulty uploading images, but there will be 2-3 images for every
project subcategory
