# Introduction

The photoelectric effect refers to the process where solids emit electrons upon being illuminated by light with a frequency beyond a certain threshold. Understanding the photoelectric effect is essential as it serves as evidence for the quantum nature of light, or the description of light as discrete particles known as photons. To study the photoelectric effect, I obtain multiple IV curves for various frequencies of light by varying the applied voltage across the a photomultiplier tube. I then use linear fitting for points within the IV curve near the x-axis to identify stopping voltages. In doing so, I seek to verify the ratio of h/e, where h refers to Planck’s constant and e to the elementary charge, and to identify the contact potential within the phototube. By calculating the slope of a stopping voltage versus frequency plot, I obtain an approximate ratio of h/e of (4.982 ± 0.747)E-15 Vs which has around a 21% error compared to the theoretical value he = 4.136E-15 Vs. Observing the y-intercept of the stopping voltage versus frequency plot, I also report a contact potential of (1.961 ± 0.286) V.
