#Introduction

Within medical image processing, the process of image registration remains essential for the automated analysis of medical images. By comparing a set of experimental medical images to an established set of templates, the experimental images can undergo semantic segmentation- or the process of dividing the image into a set of various regions with established labels. In this project, I explore the application of image registration and segmentation on the coronal sections of the brain- indexed from a larger set of test fMRI images. The field of medical image processing remains especially important to realize the capability of processing large sets of fMRI data which has far-reaching research applications in medicine. Since the semantic labeling of portions of the fMRI scans provides the efficient identification of the anatomy displayed within an image, the automated process could, for example, pave the way for improved research on the development of the human brain over time by tracking the changes in each anatomical feature of the brain. By tracking the development of the human brain using fMRI data, it becomes possible to understand the specific changes that occur within each portion of a patientâ€™s brain under the condition of brain disease- allowing for better treatment and diagnosis. Since manual segmentation procedures require the expertise of a worker, it is prone to human error, poor accuracy, and adds both timely and monetary expenses. In particular, it would be difficult for the manual segmentation to process vast amounts of MRI data in a timely fashion. With these issues in mind, it is particularly important to improve the accuracy of the automatic segmentation procedures to consistently yield more accurate results and save monetary expenses.

Note: I am currently having difficulty uploading images, but there will be 2-3 images for every
project subcategory
