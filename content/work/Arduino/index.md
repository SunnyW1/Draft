# Introduction




Data acquisition, or the collection of real-world measurements and conversion into digital data, has many applications within daily life and research. When performing an experiment, it is essential to regulate laboratory conditions and helpful to automate the data collection process to reduce sources of error. To explore data acquisition, this project focuses on using the Arduino Uno to monitor temperature, manage an external fan and heating pad based on the temperature readings, and display data on to an LCD display. To test the ability of the heating and cooling system, temperature data was collected and averaged over a thirty-minute period and compared to the desired temperatures of 20°C and 25°C. Removing the need for manual adjustments, this setup is meant to serve as a small-scale example of how the Arduino Uno is used to automate a temperature regulating system. This apparatus can be used to thermally regulate smaller volumes that do not require immediate response.

I am currently having difficulty uploading images, but there will be 2-3 images for every
